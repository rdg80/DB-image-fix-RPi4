# DB-image-fix-RPi4

This is a tutorial on how to fix an old image that was put out back in 2021? And seemed to work fine back then, but was having issues loading now (2024).  This might not work for everyone, but this is how I got it to work in my use case. 

Error:
start4.elf: is not compatible

# Main Outline - Steps to fix image

## I. Get Image onto SD Card
   A. Use disk/card imager of choice  
   
   - Raspberry Pi Imager  
   
   - Win32DiskImager  
   
   - balenaEtcher  

## II. Get Image to Boot Without Errors
   A. Replace `fixup4.dat` and `start4.elf` files  
   
   1. Find known good working files  
   
   2. Replace old files with the known good working files  
   
   B. **Checkpoint**: Splashscreen intro video should now play when booting up RPi4 with SD card image

   1. But nothing else will work - video will play and no response from anything else

## III. Add Additional Files to Image for Further Modifications (to fix)
   A. Add `ssh` and `wpa_supplicant.conf` files  
   
   1. Edit `wpa_supplicant.conf` to match your internal network credentials  
   
   B. The `ssh` file automatically enables SSH, allowing you to log in using a terminal emulator  

   C. The `wpa_supplicant.conf` file allows your RPi4 to connect to local network so you can connect to it

## IV. Use a Terminal Emulator to Connect to RPi4
   A. Run the specific "update" commands  
   
   B. Reboot  

## V. Plug in Gamepad and Configure
   A. After gamepad is configured, you should be able to navigate through the menus  

## VI. Fixing the Reboot and Shutdown Options in Menus
   A. Log in to your RPi again using a terminal emulator  
   
   1. Run `chmod` commands to grant privileges for the Reboot and Shutdown options
